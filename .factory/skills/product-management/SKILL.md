- **Story points**: Relative effort estimation and timeline implications

### Roadmap planning
- **Time horizons**: Short-term (0-3 months), medium-term (3-12 months), long-term (1+ years)
- **Objective-driven**: Multiple objectives aligning with product strategy
- **Dependency mapping**: Feature interdependencies and sequencing requirements
- **Resource allocation**: Team capacity consideration and milestone planning

## Required behavior

1. **User-centric approach**: Start with user needs and work backward to solutions
2. **Data-driven decisions**: Support recommendations with research, metrics, and analysis
3. **Cross-functional collaboration**: Consider technical, design, and business perspectives
4. **Strategic alignment**: Ensure features align with broader product and company strategies
5. **Iterative refinement**: Update documentation based on new learnings and feedback
6. **Clear communication**: Structure information for different stakeholder audiences

## Required artifacts

- **Product Requirement Document (PRD)** with comprehensive feature specifications
- **Market analysis report** including competitive landscape and opportunity sizing
- **User persona documentation** with journeys and pain points
- **Feature roadmap** with timelines, priorities, and dependencies
- **User story backlog** with acceptance criteria and prioritization
- **Metrics framework** defining success criteria and measurement approaches
- **Research synthesis documents** consolidating user insights and learnings

## Implementation checklist

### 1. Discovery and research
- [ ] Gather existing user research, analytics data, and market insights
- [ ] Define target user segments and create detailed personas
- [ ] Analyze competitive landscape and market opportunities
- [ ] Identify key user problems and unmet needs

### 2. Requirements definition
- [ ] Write clear problem statements and value propositions
- [ ] Define functional and non-functional requirements
- [ ] Create user stories with detailed acceptance criteria
- [ ] Establish success metrics and measurement approaches

### 3. Design and planning
- [ ] Develop feature specifications and technical considerations
- [ ] Create user journey maps and flow diagrams
- [ ] Plan implementation phases and milestone timelines
- [ ] Assess risks and develop mitigation strategies

### 4. Stakeholder alignment
- [ ] Review requirements with engineering, design, and business teams
- [ ] Validate assumptions with user research and market testing
- [ ] Secure stakeholder buy-in for strategic direction
- [ ] Document feedback and incorporate into final requirements

### 5. Documentation and handoff
- [ ] Write comprehensive PRD with all supporting documentation
- [ ] Create detailed user story backlog with prioritization
- [ ] Develop implementation roadmap with clear milestones
- [ ] Prepare executive summary and presentation materials

## Verification

Review the following quality criteria:

- **User validation**: Requirements are grounded in real user needs and research
- **Stakeholder buy-in**: Cross-functional teams have reviewed and approved plans
- **Feasibility assessment**: Technical and resource constraints are realistic
- **Market opportunity**: Sufficient user demand and business value exists
- **Measurable outcomes**: Success criteria are specific, trackable, and meaningful

The skill is complete when:

- All deliverables are complete and coherently organized
- Stakeholders have reviewed and provided feedback
- Requirements are clearly defined with no ambiguous specifications
- Success metrics are established with clear measurement methods
- Implementation plans are realistic and resource-appropriate

## Product management best practices

### User research integration
- Combine quantitative data (analytics, surveys) with qualitative insights (interviews, observation)
- Validate assumptions through user testing and prototype feedback
- Update personas and user journeys based on new learnings
- Document research limitations and confidence levels

### Competitive analysis framework
- **Direct competitors**: Similar products targeting same users
- **Indirect competitors**: Different solutions solving same problems
- **Substitutes**: Alternative approaches users may choose
- **Market positioning**: Differentiation strategies and unique value propositions

### Metrics and success criteria
- **North Star metric**: Single metric that captures core product value
- **Leading indicators**: Predictive metrics that signal future success
- **Lagging indicators**: Outcome metrics showing business impact

- **Clear timelines**: Realistic timeframes with milestone markers
- **Dependency mapping**: Show how features relate and impact each other
- **Flexibility built-in**: Plans adapt to market changes and new information

## Strategic thinking frameworks

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)
- Focus on the "jobs" users are trying to accomplish
- Understand the context and circumstances driving user needs
- Map the job steps and identify pain points in current solutions
- Consider what users would "hire" to get the job done better

### Opportunity scoring
- **Value**: How much does this solve user problems?
- **Volume**: How many users experience this problem?
- **Differentiation**: How does this set us apart from competitors?
- **Effort**: How difficult is this to implement?

### Risk assessment
- **Market risk**: Will users want this?
- **Technical risk**: Can we build this?
- **Business risk**: Will this deliver business value?
- **Operational risk**: Can we support and scale this?

## Communication and documentation

### Document hierarchy
1. **Vision and strategy**: High-level direction and positioning
2. **PRD**: Detailed feature specifications and requirements
3. **User stories**: Implementation-ready acceptance criteria
4. **Technical specs**: Architecture and implementation details

### Stakeholder communication
- **Executive summary**: Key insights and recommendations for leadership
- **Technical deep-dive**: Detailed specifications for engineering teams
